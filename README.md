PHP Rest API codebase with Thermostat
!! No Frameworks !!

My primary focus has been on constructing the REST API using PHP. During the development process, I worked on establishing connections with thermostats via APIs. These APIs were designed to facilitate various functionalities, including reading thermostat information, creating new thermostats, and editing temperature settings.
